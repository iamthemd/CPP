Multithreading is more like multitasking. with the help of multitasking, you can run two
or more programs on your computer concurrently.
There are two ways of multitasking such as process based and thread based.

The process-based multitasking helps in maintaining the concurrent execution of process.
The thread-based multitasking helps in handling the concurrent execution of piece of the
same programs.

The meaning of multithreading is that two or more threads runnig concurrently. and each 
thread is handling a different task.It allows you to perfom many activities simultaneously.

A thread is nothing but light-weight process. Each thread execute different parts of program.
And each thread shared memory and other resources.
