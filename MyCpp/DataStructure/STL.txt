STL: Standard Template Library
- STL is colection of C++ template classes for common programming data structure such as
  list, stack, array etc.
- It is container library with	algorithm, iterator and container classes.
- Using STL in c++ makes code more expressive, simpler and easy to understand.

STL Component:
	- Algorithm : Algortithms are function that are applied on container and provide an operaton
	              for the container's contents.
				: Typees of algorithms in STL
				  - Searching
				  - Sorting
				  - Numeric
				  - Modyfying and Non-Modyfying
	- Container : Containers are object that are used to store the information
				- Seqeunce Container : Arrays, Vector, List, Dequeue 
				- Associative Container: Set, Multiset, Map, Multimap
				- Unorder associative container: Unordered_set,Unordered_multiset, Unordered_map, Unordered_multimap
				- Container Adaptor: Stack, Queue, Priority_queue
	- Iterator : Iterator are used to point to addresses in STL container.
				 the most commonly used iterator operations are begin(), end(), advance(), next() and prev().
			Types of Iterator:
			- Input Iterator
			- Output Iterator
			- Random-access Iterator
			- Forward Iterator
			- Bidirectional Iterator
	- Function : STL includes classes that overload the function call operator(). Instance of these classes are called functor.
