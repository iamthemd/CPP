STL: Standard Template Library
- STL is colection of C++ template classes for common programming data structure such as
  list, stack, array etc.
- It is container library with	algorithm, iterator and container classes.
- Using STL in c++ makes code more expressive, simpler and easy to understand.

STL Component:
	- Algorithm : Algortithms are function that are applied on container and provide an operaton
	              for the container's contents.
				: STL provide number of algorithms that can be used of any container, irresepctive of
				  their type. Algorithms ibrary contain built in function that can performs complex
				  algorithms on the data structure.
				: For ex: once can reverse a range with reverse(), sort a range with sort(), search in
				  range with binary_search() and so on.
				: Typees of algorithms in STL
				  - Searching
				  - Sorting
				  - Numeric
				  - Modyfying and Non-Modyfying
	- Container : Containers are object that are used to store the information.
				: Containes library provide the containers that are used to create data structure like
				  array, linklist, map etc.
				: Container are generic, they can hold any type of data.
				- Seqeunce Container : Arrays, Vector, List, Dequeue 
				- Associative Container: Set, Multiset, Map, Multimap
				- Unorder associative container: Unordered_set,Unordered_multiset, Unordered_map, Unordered_multimap
				- Container Adaptor: Stack, Queue, Priority_queue
	- Iterator : Iterators are used to point to addresses in STL container.
				 the most commonly used iterator operations are begin(), end(), advance(), next() and prev().
			   : Iterators in STL are used to point to the containers. Iterator actually acts as a bridge
			     between containers and algorithms.
				Types of Iterator:
				- Input Iterator
				- Output Iterator
				- Random-access Iterator
				- Forward Iterator
				- Bidirectional Iterator
	- Function : STL includes classes that overload the function call operator(). Instance of these classes are called functor.

* What are the containers in STL?
  Following are some of common container:
  - vector : replicates array but dynamic.
  - queue : repicates queue.
  - stack : replicates stack.
  - priority_queue : replicates heap.
  - list : replicates double link list.
  - set : replicates tree.
  - map : associative arrays.

  PAIR and TUPLE Template:
  Although pair and tuple are not part of the container but they are very commonly required 
  and they make certain things very easy to implement.

  Syntax: pair<T1, T2> pair1, pair2;
